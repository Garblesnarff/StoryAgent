I want to use Hume's EVI-2 for the text to speech.

To use Hume's EVI-2 model as an audiobook narrator, you need to integrate it into your application using the API keys and configuration details you have. Below is a Python code example to help you get started, along with a description of how to implement it.

import requests

Define your API credentials and configuration
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
secret_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
config_id = 'YOUR_CONFIG_ID'

Set up the endpoint and headers for the API request
url = 'https://api.hume.ai/v1/evi-2/narrate'
headers = {
'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

Define the payload with the text you want to narrate
payload = {
'text': 'Your audiobook text goes here.',
'config_id': config_id
}

Make a POST request to the Hume API
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

Check the response status and get the audio file URL
if response.status_code == 200:
audio_url = response.json().get('audio_url')
print(f'Audio narration available at: {audio_url}')
else:
print(f'Failed to get narration: {response.status_code} - {response.text}')

Description of Implementation

API Credentials: Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', and 'YOUR_CONFIG_ID' with your actual Hume API key, secret key, and configuration ID.
Endpoint Setup: The API endpoint for narration is https://api.hume.ai/v1/evi-2/narrate. Ensure you include the correct headers for authorization and content type.
Payload: The payload includes the text you want to be narrated and your configuration ID. Replace 'Your audiobook text goes here.' with the actual text from your audiobook.
Making the Request: Use Python's requests library to make a POST request to the Hume API. This request will send your text for processing by Hume's EVI-2 model.
Handling the Response: If the request is successful (status code 200), the response will contain a URL where you can access the narrated audio. If not, handle errors by checking the status code and response text.
This setup allows you to convert text into audio using Hume's EVI-2 model, which can be particularly useful for creating AI-narrated audiobooks. Make sure to install the requests library if you haven't already by running pip install requests.
