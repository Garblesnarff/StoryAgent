I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know.

Do not fear to think even the most not-probable.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Good-night.” In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr.. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds—all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'It is coming. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much impressment—assumed, of course—and showed a great bundle of white flowers. “These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said. “For me?', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Oh, Dr.. Van Helsing!” “Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.” Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:— “Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.” To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:— “No trifling with me!', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions.

The Professor’s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopœia that I ever heard of.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:— “Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.” “Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck.

I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden strewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Dr.. Seward’s Diary. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now. Let all be put down exactly.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s annual work.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs.. Westenra coming out of the morning room.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:— “You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'He rubbed his hands together, and said:— “Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'My treatment is working,” to which she answered:— “You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this morning is due in part to me.” “How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor. “Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'She was sleeping soundly—so soundly that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'You will be pleased with her, I am sure.” She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen grey.', 'image_url': None, 'audio_url': None}, {'text': 'He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room.
