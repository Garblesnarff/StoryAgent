To implement LangChain in your application for tracking prompts to Google's Gemini LLM, you can follow these steps:

1. Setup Your Environment

    Install Required Libraries: You'll need Python and to install LangChain along with Google's generative AI library. Use:
    bash

    pip install langchain langchain-google-genai google-generativeai

    Set Up Google API Key: Ensure you have an API key for Google's Gemini API. This can typically be obtained from Google AI Studio or similar services.


2. Initialize Gemini LLM with LangChain

    API Key Setup: Securely set your API key in your environment variables or directly in your code for development purposes:
    python

import os
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = 'your_api_key_here'

Import and Initialize the LLM: Use the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI from LangChain to interact with Gemini.
python

    from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
    llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro", temperature=0.7)  # Adjust temperature as needed


3. Handling Prompts with LangChain

    Prompt Templates: Create dynamic prompts using PromptTemplate for structured input:
    python

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
template = "Interpret the emotions conveyed by the emoji: {emoji}."
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["emoji"])

Chaining for Memory: Implement conversation memory to keep track of prompts and responses:
python

    from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
    from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

    conversation = ConversationChain(
        llm=llm, 
        verbose=True, 
        memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
    )


4. Using the Chain

    Invoke the Chain: Use the chain to process user inputs:
    python

    response = conversation.run("What does ðŸ˜Š feel like?")
    print(response)


    Here, ConversationChain will automatically manage the conversation history, allowing Gemini to respond contextually based on previous prompts.


5. Advanced Features

    Streaming Responses: If you need to handle large outputs or want to see the model's thought process in real-time:
    python

    for chunk in llm.stream("Write a scientific paper on quantum mechanics"):
        print(chunk.content)

    Safety and Customization: While the example didn't cover detailed safety features, remember you can configure safety settings through the Gemini API for handling sensitive queries.


6. Error Handling and Logging

    Ensure you implement proper error handling, especially around API calls, to deal with potential issues like rate limiting or API key errors.


7. Persistent Memory

    For production applications, consider using persistent storage for conversation history, like Firebase or any database service, to maintain continuity across sessions.


By integrating LangChain with Gemini, you leverage the strengths of both for creating more sophisticated, context-aware applications. Always keep in mind to handle API keys securely and manage the flow of information to and from the LLM to ensure your application is both efficient and user-friendly.
